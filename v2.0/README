This version includes a css and a js file for a drop down menu on my about.html 
Haven't added much else and I admit I had to use chatGPT for my js but now I understand it I feel confident I tweek it and add things to it when I need to.
CSS again I used ChatGPT to explain things in more details or help me find the right colour code
